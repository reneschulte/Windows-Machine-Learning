# Modified Windows Machine Learning Samples

This repo contains my modifications of the Windows Machine Learning (WinML) samples.
For example the SqueezeNet live view with Speech output.

## API Samples

In the Samples directory, you will find samples that demonstrate API usage and specific features of Windows Machine Learning.
For example, the MNIST sample shows you how to use Visual Studio to easily generate the model interface for your application. The SnapCandy sample shows you how you can easily integrate your camera stream into your machine learning model.
